## Review: Data-driven methodology for detecting treatment effect heterogeneity

Collaboration: UCL MRC-CTU and the Alan Turing Institute

### Interest:

- Test for the presence of differential effects
- Identify subgroups that represent varied responses to treatment
- Estimate the effects for the determined patient subpopulations
- Characterise such subpopulations (Variable Selection)

### Task: Comprehensive Simulation Study

Themes: 

- Tree based methods
- Non tree based methods
- Metalearners
