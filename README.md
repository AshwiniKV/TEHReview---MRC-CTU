## Review: Data-driven methodology for detecting treatment effect heterogeneity

Collaboration: UCL MRC-CTU and the Alan Turing Institute

Interest:

- Testing for the presence of differential effects
- Identifying subgroups that represent distinct responses to treatment
- Estimating the effects for the determined patient subpopulations
- Characterise such subpopulations (Variable Selection)

Task: Comprehensive Simulation Study

Themes: 

- Tree based methods
- Non tree based methods
- Metalearners
